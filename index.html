We spent the beginning of the day mostly situating ourselves with our hotel rooms, and then we decided to try a local restaurant for lunch.  I ordered the blackened fish tacos and they were extremely fresh and delicious. Later that evening we all went for a walk on the beach and explored the landscape. </p>

                        <p class="lead"> Tuesday, I was really excited for the snorkeling activity we had planned. The snorkeling tour began with us all going for a ride on the tour boat, which featured a really cool open bar and a slide that landed straight into the ocean. Once we reached our snorkeling destination, the tour guides supplied us all with snorkels and fins, and they allowed us to swim around and explore the underwater environment for over an hour.  I really enjoyed seeing all of the exotic fish, and I was able to dive a lot deeper than I expected.</p>

                        <p class="lead">After the events of Tuesday, we were all feeling pretty tired.  Instead of planning another physical activity, we decided to spend the day relaxing and working on our tans at Eagle Beach.  This beach was my personal favorite of the entire trip because it was so easy to walk to from where we were staying and the water was really clear.  Although I ended up getting a little bit of a sunburn, this day was really memorable for me because I got to spend the entire day hanging out with my family in the sun.  Later that night, we went to another local restaurant where I enjoyed some of the best tuna of my life.</p>

                        <p class="lead">On Thursday, we decided to finish our trip with an exciting ATV tour.  I think we were all really excited to be allowed to drive the ATVs, but I was totally unprepared for the beautiful scenery we would be traveling through.  To start the tour, we boarded the tour van that took us to the ATV site.  We were then given our helmets and the rules for the ATV tour before they set us loose.  I personally had a lot of fun following my family around as we drove through the terrain, and we were rewarded with a really beautiful overlook at the end of the tour.  I thought that it was a great way to end our vacation and I hope to return to Aruba at some point in the future.</p>
